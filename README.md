## Jenkin Configurations

- Scripted Pipeline to a Declarative Pipeline
- adding descriptive stages and post sections. In one of those post blocks, we included a placeholder for sending notifications.

- Sending Notifications in Pipeline but this time in Declarative Pipeline. First we’ll integrate calls to notification services Slack, HipChat, and Email into our Pipeline. Then we’ll refactor those calls into a single Step in a Shared Library, which we’ll reuse as needed, keeping our Jenkinsfile

## Docker Image
- Configuration of Dockerfile
- custom image with Packer & Terraform
